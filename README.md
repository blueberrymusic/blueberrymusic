### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The repo for my book [Deep Learning: A Visual Approach](https://nostarch.com/deep-learning-visual-approach)
contains all of the figures and Jupyter notebooks from the book, along with 3 bonus chapters, *all for free*! 
Click the repo below or [click here to go to the book's repo](https://github.com/blueberrymusic/Deep-Learning-A-Visual-Approach).


### Don't see what you're looking for?

The other repos host slides for talks, code for projects, and resources, as well as the figures
and notebooks for my first deep learning book. Click on the *Repositories* tab above to see
all these other things.
