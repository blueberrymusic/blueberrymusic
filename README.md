### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The repo for my book [Deep Learning: A Visual Approach](https://nostarch.com/deep-learning-visual-approach)
contains all of the figures and Jupyter notebooks from the book, *for free*! There are also 3
bonus chapters (coming very soon).

### Don't see what you're looking for?

The other repos host slides for talks, code for projects, and resources, as well as the figures
and notebooks for my first deep learning book. Click on the *Repositories* tab above to see
all these other things.
